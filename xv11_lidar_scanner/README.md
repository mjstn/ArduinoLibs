# XV11 Neato Lidar Additions to use with 3D Scanner 
The files here are additions to the sweep-3d-scanner files. sweep-3d-scanner is an open source community project with the goal of making an inexpensive, portable and easy to use 3D scanner. 

So as a base for these files you would need to obtain the files from https://github.com/scanse and integrate the files here into those.

In short there is added now an xv11_sweeppy.py module and then in scanner.py see usage of option -x  and boolean  use_xv11
